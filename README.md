# Book Search
## Description
This project uses the MERN (Mongo DB, Express, React and Node.js ) in conjunction with the google books API to create a book search app.

### Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to present the user with a Book Search that fetches book data from the google books API and allows the user to manage books on their Saved Books page. 

### Functionality:

Users can use the Search page to search for books with the Google Books API. In order to Save Books, the user must sign up and login to their account. Once logged in, the save books button appears on the book cards returned in search results. When a user clicks the save books button the Book is added to the user's Saved Books page. A user can delete a book using the delete book button on the Saved books page.  


### Goals Accomplished:

Users are able to manage a list of Saved books integrated with Google's Books API.
